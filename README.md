# bakery-GO

Implementation of Lamport's Bakery Algorithm in GO by Danish Malik and Kyle DeBates.

Once in the directory containing the 'bakery.go' file, you can run the code by entering in the command line:

`go run bakery.go [number_of_servers] [number_of_customers]`

where [number_of_servers] and [number_of_customers] are integers.
